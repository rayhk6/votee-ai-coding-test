# Performance

| Item                               | Tries | Avg Guess | Error |
| :--------------------------------- | :---: | :-------: | ----: |
| Without checking against a-z round |  100  |   6.53    |     7 |
| With checking against a-z round    |  100  |    7.1    |     0 |
| Final                              |  100  |   6.77    |     0 |

# Backtest

| Logic             | Tries | Avg Guess | Min | Max |
| :---------------- | :---: | :-------: | :-: | --: |
| Normal            | 14855 |   7.53    |  3  |  10 |
| Vowels first      | 14855 |   7.45    |  3  |  10 |
| By char frequency | 14855 |   7.15    |  2  |  10 |

## To-do

1. <s>Improve error guessing (e.g. civic , i is "correct" in position from first a-z guessing, leading to failure since i will not be used later)</s>
2. <s>>Changing the a-z guessing mechanism may improve the performance, e.g. vowels words will be guessed first</s>
3. If there are more than 1 possible combination from dictionary and the count is less than the count of possible characters, the program should try with dictionary combination first.
