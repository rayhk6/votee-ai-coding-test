<h2> How to use it</h2>

Simply run below

node index.js

## Open packages used

1. dotenv https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv

# Performance

<h4> Without checking against a-z round 
Tries: 100
Average count: 6.53
Error: 7

<h4> With checking against a-z round
Tries: 100
Average count: 7.1
Error: 0

## To-do

1. <s>Improve error guessing (e.g. civic , i is "correct" in position from first a-z guessing, leading to failure since i will not be used later)</s>
2. Changing the a-z guessing mechanism may improve the performance, e.g. vowels words will be guessed first
